In this lab, we went through videos 3 and 4 of the ionic tutorial videos.  While we did not write much code, these videos
were very informative, especially about making classes and custom types (both of which will be extremely useful).  Like I said
prior, we did not add much code, so there is not much to see in regards to the screenshot.  In fact, nothing changed
visually from the last lab, we are just building upon the same project throughout the videos.  This one added a lot of
templates for what we will be doing in the future.
