In this lab, we went through the video lessons 00-02, followed along, and added the code that the instructor was. 
This was a fairly light lab, since we did not have to make much at all.  At the end of these videos, we only have a
basic app that runs, made another "page" called edit-todos, and made a folder of services that will be used in 
up coming lessons.  The code that is added is found in the src/app/ folder.  Even though we did not add much code, 
the videos helped a lot with the understanding of the layout of the files and the meaning of the code that is 
generated/needed.  This is a good starting point for developing in Ionic. 

Attatched is the picture of the home page, the edit-todo page is empty at the moment, so it won't show anything, 
but it's there in code.
