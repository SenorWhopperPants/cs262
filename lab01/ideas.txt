Exercise 1.1:
Application ideas:
	- Class Grade Calculator: this will let the user enter syllabus info for each of
		their classes (it will save all of the classes) and will let them 
		continually enter the grades they get in their classes and calculates 
		their current grade. 

	- Calvin Dating App: an app that allows users to find that special someone from 
		Calvin, but with a twist: the user can only contact others with pre-set 
		Bible verses.  Users will make their own profiles with info about themselves
		and will be able to search for others and contact them via the above description.
